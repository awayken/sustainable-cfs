# Sustainable CFS

  > A landing page showcasing how to be sustainable at Carsforsale.

At Carsforsale, we want to be as sustainable and eco-friendly as we can. We're a medium-sized company that's
growing all the time, and the habits of individuals can have a big impact. This site
was created based on the tips and recommendations of the CFS Climate Club. Feel free to bring these
recommendations back to your own work environment.

This is the demo site for my [Introduction to Web Components](https://github.com/awayken/web-components-introduction-presentation) presentation.
