# Sustainable CFS

  > A landing page showcasing how to be sustainable at Carsforsale.

## Premise

At Carsforsale, we want to be as sustainable and eco-friendly as we can. We're a medium-sized company that's
growing all the time, and the habits of individuals can have a big impact. This site
was created based on the tips and recommendations of the CFS Climate Club. Feel free to bring these
recommendations back to your own work environment.

## Wait, what is this?

This is the demo site for my [Introduction to Web Components](https://github.com/awayken/web-components-introduction-presentation) presentation.

## Running the Demo

The site requires no build process. It should "just work" in a modern browser that supports web components.
However, the site was developed using the very handy `es-dev-server`.

To start the site:

```sh
npm start
```
