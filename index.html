                <p>Did you know that every break room has a recycling bin? It's the blue container near the first-aid kit. Just drop in
                    your cans and bottles to recycle them. If you like helping kids in need, you can take an extra step and pull the tab
                    off first and drop that into the Ronald McDonald's House Charity.</p>

                <p>Don't leave your favorite mug or thermos at home. Bring it to work. The coffee shop can make your favorite beverage
                    in your own vessel. It's reusable, washable and shows off your fun side. Bring a reusable water bottle to keep
                    hydrated throughout the day. The water fountains and fridges all offer cold, filtered water at any time of the day.

                <p>Bringing lunch from home is a cost-effective and eco-friendly way to dine during the day. Bring your own metal
                    utensils from home so that you can wash and reuse them instead of throwing away plastic ones. You can use the towels
                    in the break room for drying, so you don't use any paper towels. The cloth towels also make great napkins.</p>

                <p>Liven up your desk with a live plant. They add some color to the area while also purifying the air. Many varieties
                    require very little watering or sunlight making them perfect for the indoors.</p>

                <p>Many of our conference and break-out rooms see some sort of traffic during the day, but often the lights stay on well
                    beyond the end of the meeting. Turn the lights off if you're the last one out, or if you walk by an empty room. The
                    environment will thank you.</p>
